# Australia Test Batting

Scraped data off of cricinfo for Australia test batting stats.
Cleaned the data and created further variables to analyse.
Found strong correlations between multiple variables.
Will create a model to try predict batting average from other independent variables such as HS, 50_convergences, etc
